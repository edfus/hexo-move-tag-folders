# hexo-move-tag-folders

this plugin is designed for moving the tag folders in `hexo.config.tag_dir`(the config.yml in hexo folder (not the theme's!)) to `hexo.config.category_dir/category.name` which the tag related to.

notice that you shouldn't use the same tag in different categories and each post must have just one category.
